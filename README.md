<img width="234" height="224" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d70ccf11-7e86-40ed-9ae2-84eaf0c593f0" />

## Overview
This project is a console-based implementation of the UNO card game,
developed using C++ as part of the Programming Fundamentals course.

The game runs entirely in the terminal and follows the basic rules of UNO.
It focuses on core programming concepts such as control structures,
functions, file handling, and data management.

## Features
- Two-player console-based gameplay
- Implementation of core UNO rules (draw, skip, reverse, wild cards)
- Turn-based game flow
- Game results stored in a text file

## Technologies Used
- Language: C++
- Environment: Console / Terminal

## File Structure
- main.cpp  
  Contains the complete game logic and implementation.
- result.txt  
  Stores the results of completed game sessions.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/sohaibAkhlaq/UNO_Game.git
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the program:
g++ main.cpp -o uno_game
4. Run the executable:
./uno_game


## Learning Outcomes
- Strengthened understanding of programming fundamentals
- Practice with conditional logic and loops
- Experience with file handling in C++
- Improved problem-solving and logic-building skills

## Future Improvements
- Single-player mode with AI
- Better rule validation
- Improved code modularization
